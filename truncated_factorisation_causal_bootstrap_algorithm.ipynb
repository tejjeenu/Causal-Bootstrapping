    "## What is a Truncated Factorisation Causal Bootstrap Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is an algorithm which resamples the dataset to create a new dataset using the **truncated factorisation** of a causal graph.\n",
    "- The idea comes from Pearl’s **do-calculus** and the **g-formula**.\n",
    "- Instead of conditioning on mediators (front door) or confounders (back door) alone, it uses the **entire causal structure**.\n",
    "- The joint distribution of all variables is factorised according to the causal graph.\n",
    "- To simulate an intervention `do(X = x)`, we **truncate** (remove) the conditional distribution of `X` given its parents.\n",
    "- All other variables are resampled from their conditional distributions given their parents.\n",
    "- This allows us to estimate causal effects even in complex systems with:\n",
    "  - multiple confounders,\n",
    "  - mediators,\n",
    "  - chains of causes.\n",
    "- The key requirement is that the **causal graph is correctly specified** and all parent variables are observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to assess whether a new teaching method (the “cause” **X**) improves exam performance (the “effect” **Y**).\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are multiple observed variables:\n",
    "  - prior grades,\n",
    "  - motivation,\n",
    "  - study hours,\n",
    "  - practice problems.\n",
    "- Some of these variables affect both the teaching method assignment and exam performance.\n",
    "- Others lie on causal paths between **X** and **Y**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal structure (simplified):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior Grades -> Teaching Method -> Study Hours -> Exam Performance\n",
    "- Motivation -> Study Hours\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume all parent variables of each node are observed.\n",
    "- To estimate the causal effect of the teaching method:\n",
    "  - We **intervene** on **X** by fixing it to a chosen value.\n",
    "  - We remove the probability model `P(X | Parents(X))`.\n",
    "  - We resample all downstream variables using their conditional distributions.\n",
    "- By repeatedly resampling, we generate a bootstrapped dataset that reflects:\n",
    "  - “What exam performance would look like if everyone received the same teaching method.”\n"
