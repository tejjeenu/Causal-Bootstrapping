A confounder (or confounding variable) is a third variable that is associated with both the exposure (independent variable) and the outcome (dependent variable) in a study in a way that can distort the observed relationship between them. If this third variable is not properly controlled for, it may produce a misleading estimate of the effect of the exposure on the outcome, because the observed association may actually be due, in whole or in part, to the influence of the confounder rather than to the exposure itself. 

Age is commonly considered a confounder because it is both related to many exposures and strongly associated with many outcomes in health research. For example, older individuals may have had more time to accumulate certain exposures (such as long-term environmental exposures or lifestyle habits) and are also more likely to develop many diseases or adverse health outcomes simply because of biological aging processes. If one group in a study is older on average than another, the difference in outcomes between these groups may be due to age rather than the exposure of interest unless age is accounted for in the analysis. This is why age is routinely adjusted for or stratified in epidemiological studies — to separate the effect of the exposure from the effect of age. 

Similarly, sex (or biological gender) can act as a confounder because it is associated with both exposures and outcomes in many contexts. Men and women often differ in behaviors, physiological characteristics, and risk profiles, and these differences can influence both exposure levels and health outcomes. For instance, patterns of lifestyle factors such as physical activity or smoking may differ by sex, and many diseases (such as cardiovascular conditions or autoimmune diseases) also show different baseline risks between males and females. If these sex-related differences are not taken into account, the observed association between an exposure and an outcome might be biased, reflecting differences in sex distribution rather than a true effect of the exposure.

In many observational studies, age and sex are among the most frequently considered potential confounders, along with other common confounding variables. Because both age and sex are known risk factors for a wide range of outcomes and can also be related to the exposure under study, failing to adjust for them can lead to biased or misleading conclusions. Researchers use a variety of methods — such as stratification, multivariable regression, matching, or standardization — to control for age and sex in order to isolate the true effect of the exposure of interest on the outcome.
